The corrected version of the CSS code is as follows:
```css
div {
  width: calc(100px + 50px);
}
```
In this corrected version, there are no spaces between the operators (+) and operands (100px and 50px).  This ensures that the browser can correctly parse and evaluate the calculation, resulting in a `width` of 150px for the `div` element. 

Another example illustrating potential issues:

Incorrect:
```css
.element {
  height: calc( 100vh - 10px );
}
```
Correct:
```css
.element {
  height: calc(100vh - 10px);
}
```
