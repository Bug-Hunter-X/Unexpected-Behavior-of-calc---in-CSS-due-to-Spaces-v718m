The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, if there are spaces between the operators and operands in the `calc()` function, it can lead to unexpected results or parsing errors. For example, the following code will cause an error:
```css
div {
  width: calc( 100px + 50px );
}
```
The correct way to use the `calc()` function is without spaces between the operators and operands:
```css
div {
  width: calc(100px + 50px);
}
```
