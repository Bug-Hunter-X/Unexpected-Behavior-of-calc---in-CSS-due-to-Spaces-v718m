# Unexpected Behavior of calc() in CSS due to Spaces
This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle error in CSS that can be encountered when using the `calc()` function.  Incorrect spacing within the `calc()` function can lead to unexpected results or even parsing errors.

## The Problem
The `calc()` function in CSS is a powerful tool for dynamic calculations.  However, if spaces are added between operators and operands, the calculation might not work as expected. 

## The Solution
Ensure that there are no spaces between operators (+, -, *, /) and operands (values with units like `px`, `em`, `%`). Maintain a concise, space-free calculation within the `calc()` parentheses.
